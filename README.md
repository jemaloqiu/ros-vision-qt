ros-vision-qt
=============

My first repository in Github is a simple ROS package (catkinized) for robot vision applications based on OpenCV and QT.

In order to compile the package, one should have installed the following dependencies: cvblobs, OpenCV, qt

To launch the application:

    roslaunch qvision cam.launch
    
    rosrun qvision qvision_main
